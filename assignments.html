            <h3>Real time multiple stream motion detection</h3>
            <p>
                Working under Zenesis Network as an intern, created a motion detection system that performs
                motion detection in real time over multiple (~50) data streams from CCTV cameras.

            <h3>Face Recognition System</h3>
            <p>
                Under Elvento Labs as an intern, created a face recognition system that detects pre-defined
                faces in local media files as well as data streams.
        
                Stack: Python
                Libraries: OpenCV, OpenFace
